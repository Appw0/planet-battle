Have you ever seen what happens when a synthetic lifeform gains access to its own code?
Auto-programmers, self-coders...Not pretty. 
It easily leads to an unhealthy fixation on 'improvement' and it's fast track to self destruction.
`
Now, unfortunately, us bio-life are just as susceptible...

I'm not sure where to go now, its just a dead end.
The station's collapsing around me and the walls have started speaking in hisses and clicks.
I think this might be the end.

To whoever may read this in the future,

There is nothing left here but death.
